# 2D-PES

This repository contains **2D potential energy surfaces (PESs)** calculated using the **PBE** functional with the **D3BJ** dispersion correction and the **def2-TZVP** basis set in the gas phase. Each surface consists of approximately **10 000** single-point calculations.

The calculations were conducted as part of a study on **London dispersion interactions** in [**Prof. Peter Chen's group**](https://chen.ethz.ch/). These datasets may serve multiple purposes, such as studying **hydrogen bonding** or training **machine learning potentials (MLPs)**.

This directory will be populated after the publication is released.  
**Stay tuned!**
